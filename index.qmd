Following the invention of the digital computer in the 1960s, advances in computer graphics allowed for greater control and accessibility for creating data visualizations.
While many graphs first stem from artistic choices, the effectiveness of these graphs may not necessarily be tested before gaining widespread accessibility.
For example, Excel 3 introduced its 3D bar chart feature in 1990, but studies around this time tend to suggest that the 2D bar chart ...
<!-- Briefly mention Barfield / Fischer? -->

A reasonable place to start comparing 2D and 3D graphs is with the bar chart.
This simple graph style helped @cleveland1984 in establishing the ordering of EPTs and can be easily extended into a 3D bar chart for direct comparisons.
While @cleveland1984 evaluated the EPTs of position along a common scale, length, and angle, they theorized that the accuracy of area would be higher than the accuracy of volume.\
Depending on the context of information retrieval from a graph, especially with A \> B comparisons, the construction of 2D and 3D bar charts are simply special cases of area and volume comparisons; 2D and 3D bar charts have varying heights based on a data value, along with fixed widths and, in the case of 3D graphs, fixed depths.

The theory theory that the EPT of area ranks higher than volume has been confirmed in several studies on 2D and 3D bar charts.
<!-- Barfield / Fischer / Zacks / Hughes -->

In the case of bar graphs, studies have shown that there is not a preference to even use 3D bar charts.
<!--Barfield / Fischer -->

Extending beyond the the bar graph, it makes sense to effectively use the third dimension for conveying information.
<!-- Grinstein / Haarman-->

The construction of 3D graphs perhaps requires even more scrutiny, especially when considering rendering options and interactivity.
<!-- Tarr / Norman? / Rodger / Wang-->

Paragraph about current use of true 3D visualizations?
