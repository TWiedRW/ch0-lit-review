  abstract = {"Making With Data: Physical Design and Craft in a Data-Driven World provides a snapshot of the practices used by contemporary designers, researchers, and artists who are creating objects, spaces, and experiences imbued with data. Creators of physical representations of data draw from a range of domains and traditions, and represent a fascinating, inspiring, and revealing cross-section of contemporary maker and data culture. To highlight the diversity of approaches, this book features a collection of first-hand accounts from 25+ international artists, designers, and scientists, documenting the process of designing and creating new physical representations and experiences with data. In each chapter, creators tell the story of how they created specific physical representations of data and illustrate that process via documentary sketches, photos, and other design artifacts. The book is divided into five themes (handcraft, participation, digital production, actuation, and the environment), each with an introduction that considers the broader social, scientific, and artistic implications of giving physical form to data. In particular, this book explores the process by which those artifacts are created, surfacing the design decisions, considerations, methods, and fabrication techniques that modern creatives use when making with data. The first book to showcase physical representations of data, and discuss the creative process behind them, approaching the topic from a multidisciplinary perspective - from computer science, data science, graphic design, art, craft, and architecture - and beautifully illustrated throughout, Making With Data is accessible and inspiring for enthusiasts and experts alike"--},

  abstract = {The just noticeable difference (JND) model reflects the visibility limitations of the human visual system (HVS), which plays an important role in perceptual image/video processing and is commonly applied to perceptual redundancy removal. However, existing JND models are usually constructed by treating the color components of three channels equally, and their estimation of the masking effect is inadequate. In this paper, we introduce visual saliency and color sensitivity modulation to improve the JND model. Firstly, we comprehensively combined contrast masking, pattern masking, and edge protection to estimate the masking effect. Then, the visual saliency of HVS was taken into account to adaptively modulate the masking effect. Finally, we built color sensitivity modulation according to the perceptual sensitivities of HVS, to adjust the sub-JND thresholds of Y, Cb, and Cr components. Thus, the color-sensitivity-based JND model (CSJND) was constructed. Extensive experiments and subjective tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the CSJND model. We found that consistency between the CSJND model and HVS was better than existing state-of-the-art JND models.},

  abstract = {Background               Electronic personal health records offer a promising way to communicate medical test results to patients. We compared the usability of tables and horizontal bar graphs for presenting medical test results electronically.                                         Methods               We conducted experiments with a convenience sample of 106 community-dwelling adults. In the first experiment, participants viewed either table or bar graph formats (between subjects) that presented medical test results with normal and abnormal findings. In a second experiment, participants viewed table and bar graph formats (within subjects) that presented test results with normal, borderline, and abnormal findings.                                         Results               Participants required less viewing time when using bar graphs rather than tables. This overall difference was due to superior performance of bar graphs in vignettes with many test results. Bar graphs and tables performed equally well with regard to recall accuracy and understanding. In terms of ease of use, participants did not prefer bar graphs to tables when they viewed only one format. When participants viewed both formats, those with experience with bar graphs preferred bar graphs, and those with experience with tables found bar graphs equally easy to use. Preference for bar graphs was strongest when viewing tests with borderline results.                                         Conclusions               Compared to horizontal bar graphs, tables required more time and experience to achieve the same results, suggesting that tables can be a more burdensome format to use. The current practice of presenting medical test results in a tabular format merits reconsideration.},
