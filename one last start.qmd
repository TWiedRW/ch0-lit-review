# Motivation and Background

Data visualizations play an essential role in understanding patterns in the structure of data. They allow for a programmatic mapping of data into a "picture" that can be used to gather insight from the viewer [@tukey1965; @tufte2001; @wilkinson2005]. Since the early 20th century, researchers have been exploring the question: what defines a good graph? [@croxton1927; @croxton1932; @cleveland1984; @vanderplas2020]. Many attempts to answer this questions have provided good recommendations, but are largely limited to the projection of graphs onto 2-dimensional (2D) surfaces. While this addresses many of the typical use cases for data visualizations, graphs created in our 3-dimensional (3D) world are largely unexplored.

Due to the practical constraint of needing to be produced on paper or digital monitors, many charts exist within the confines of a 2D space.

# Overview of Physical 3D Visualizations

The popularity of the 3D printer exploded in the early 2010's as the technology became increasingly available and cheaper. This has led to increase usage of 3D printing in many focus areas, including healthcare [@dodziuk2016] and engineering [@v2023], but has only seen novel use cases for statistical graphics. Many software programs have the ability to create 3D statistical graphics, but lack the ability to easily export the graphics into files suitable for 3D printing.

## Creating 3D Visualizations

Many software programs have the ability to create renderings of 3D charts. Excel [@msexcel] has native support for creating charts with 3D depth cues, but requires add-ins to produce charts using 3 axes. R (XXX) has a several options for creating 3D charts that have data on 3 axes [e.g., @rgl; @rayshader; @plotly], but lacks support for creating depth charts. SAS (XXX) has options such as PROC GCHART for adding depth cues and PROC G3D for surface charts. Many other software programs contain similar capabilities, such as JavaScript libraries, MathLab, Python, and more.

FIGURE PLACEHOLDER

While a number of tools exist for creating 3D data visualizations, the pipeline of getting these charts into files compatible with 3D printing is limited. For example, R has some options using the `rgl` [@rgl] and `rayshader` [@rayshader] packages, but both packages have limited tuning parameters for the resulting output files. Another option is to use 3D software, such as OpenSCAD [@kintelOpenSCADDocumentation2023], to manually create the charts, but automation with scripting programs takes time to set up.

## Current use cases

The use of 3D-printed data visualizations for statistical graphics is largely a novelty in the early 21st century. Services such as WhiteClouds ([www.whiteclouds.com](www.whiteclouds.com)) offer the ability to create a wide variety of 3D-printed graphics

# Bar Charts in Research and Practice

One of the most common types of charts is the bar chart, characterized by the use of rectangular geometries. Two variables are mapped to the geometries of the bar chart, where one axis is dedicated to a categorical variable of nominal or ordinal nature, and the other axis is for a (typically) continuous variable to denote magnitude or a response.

-   Use cases and history?

The use of 3-dimensional elements in bar charts typically involve converting the rectangular bars into rectangular prisms. The naming convention for these charts is not consistent, sometimes referred to as 2.5D charts when the additional dimension does not covey extra information [e.g., @tractinsky1999] or, more commonly, as 3D bar charts. In this dissertation, they will be consistently referred to as "3D bar charts." Many software packages include the ability to create these types of charts (e.g., Excel).

## Against 3D Bar Charts

@tufte called the use of 3d elements a "fake perspective" in his description of "chart junk", which is where visual elements add clutter the data visualization. The reasoning behind this is fairly intuitive: why include additional noise when simpler alternatives exist? Other researchers [@zacks1998; @stewart2009] have taken to calling the perspective effect "extraneous" when referring to depth cues.

The seminal work of @cleveland1984 theorized that encoding information in volumes would provide worse numerical estimation than for encodings using positions, lengths, and areas. Their reasoning stems from Steven's Power Law (XXX), a psychophysics formulation that estimates a perceived stimuli magnitude $p$ with the actual magnitude $a$ by $p=ka^\alpha$ . The estimation of $\alpha$ provides guidance to what types of stimuli are subject to the most distorted to their true scale when $\alpha=1$. (alpha for volume estimated to be X, area is Y, and length is Z). While the 3D bar charts do not lose their 2D encodings, they do gain depth, and thus volume encodings.

## For 3D Bar Charts

If empirical studies have shown that the use of depth cues on bar charts does not provide added benefits, then why are 3D bar charts used?

@levy1996 made an argument for the use of depth cues in certain situations. In a series of three experiments, @levy1996 tasked over 100 psychology students at Stanford with selecting one of various 2D and 3D charts that they thought would be best for certain scenarios. What they found was that students tended to pick 3D charts over 2D charts when needing to increase memory recollection of the chart, and about equal preference for 2D and 3D charts when presenting the information to others. @levy1996 theorized that the depth embellishments in the graphic may increase memorability of the chart by making the chart stand out. Several other studies have shown that other types of "chart junk" can increase recollection, but at the cost of participants needing longer times to process the charts [@bateman2010; @borgo2012; @pe√±a2020]. The increase of time for reading 3D bar charts was noted by @fischer2000, lending some credibility

## Conflicting Empirical Studies

When accuracy is the goal, 2D is not better than 3D in some cases

While the logic of @tufte argues against the use of 3D charts when possible, it is not necessarily the case that 3D bar charts are worse than their 2D counterparts.

**PHYSICAL 3D CHARTS**

All of the aforementioned studies have one key limitation: they are conducted in environments where the 3D bar charts are projected onto 2D surfaces. While tactile charts exist to help people with vision impairments [@goncu2008; @engel2017; @watanabe2018], their designs are vastly different than the typical 3D bar charts. As of now, research involving direct translations of 3D bar charts in the physical world do not exist.

# Heat Maps in Research and Practice

Probably need to use studies where the third dimension is for data, not depth. Not a whole lot out there on 3D heat maps in particular

-   @barfield1989

-   @kraus2020

When creating charts for three or more variables, it becomes increasingly more complex to visualize data [@grinstein2001]. One option is to map the additional variables using gestalt principles [@vanderplas2020] (Original citation?), which includes making use of color, size, and/or shapes to denote information. However, the type of data limits what variables can be mapped to which aesthetics. For quantitative variables, shape is not a suitable aesthetic, but color and size can be mapped. ....

<!-- Show examples of each of color/shape/size -- note that shape isn't suitable for quanitative 3rd dimension, while color and size can be; size isn't really suitable for categorical data unless it's ordered. -->

Heat maps are a solution to three variable visualization when

# Methods for Evaluating Visualization Effectiveness

## What makes a good chart?

@vanderplas2020 discussed various approaches to testing graphics, including numerical estimations, speed, error rates,

## Designing studies for numerical estimations

The seminal work of @cleveland1984 asked participants two questions when making comparisons between two values on a chart: (1) which of the two values was the smaller, and (2) what percentage the smaller was of the larger. The first question clarified if the participants were looking at the values correctly for the second questions, and the second question is an estimation of $A/B$, where $A<B$. Values for $A$ and $B$ were chosen so that they were equally spaced on a log scale, where ratios of $A/B$ ranged from 0.18 to 0.83.

The estimation of $A/B$ was used by (XXX) in studies regarding 2D and 3D statistical graphics.

## Limitations due to population

Quick section about populations of studies. I'm thinking about including @heer2010 for crowdsourcing, but many studies use students. @barfield1989 used novice and experienced managers and found differences in results for 2D vs. 3D. Other studies on how different populations perceive differently, such as @rice2024.

# Research Objectives

Current research has widely covered 2D and projections of 3D data visualizations, but there is little, if any, research on how these results translate to physical 3D data visualizations.

In order to establish a basis of 3D-printed charts, inspiration from early testing of statistical graphics [e.g., @cleveland1984] will be used
